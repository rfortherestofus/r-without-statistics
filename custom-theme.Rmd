# Develop a Custom Theme to Keep Your Data Viz Consistent 

In 2018, BBC data journalist Nassos Stylianou was working with a backend developer on a particularly large data set. Nassos was primarily an Excel user at the time, but this data was too large for Excel. Seeing the developer work, a light bulb went off for Nassos: if he and his data journalism team learned to use R, they could do this type of analysis on their own. 

This realization began a journey into R. This journey, which started with needing to analyze data too large for Excel to handle, would ultimately end up in a very different place. 

In 2019, Nassos, his colleague Clara Guibourg, and their team created a custom ggplot theme to create plots that match the BBC style. The code in the `bbplot` package is a great example of the value of developing a custom theme. 

But the real story of the creation of bbplot is not just about technical tools. Through learning R and creating a custom theme for others to use, Nassos, Clara and their colleagues would change the culture, remove bottlenecks, and allow the BBC to be more creative with their data viz.

To understand how big these changes were, it's helpful to understand what things looked like at the BBC before bbplot. In the mid-2010s, journalists at the BBC who wanted to make data visualization had two choices:

1. They could use an internal tool called Chart Tools. This tool could create data visualization, but only the predefined charts it had been designed to generate. 
2. They could use Excel to create mockups and then work with a graphic designer to finalize the charts. This approach led to better results, and was way more flexible, but required extensive back-and-forth with a designer. As Nassos described it, working with a designer "is just a very time consuming workflow if you think of how many visualizations the BBC does." 

Neither of these choices was ideal. And this limited set of less-than-ideal choices led to a limited output of data viz.   

That would all change when Nassos, Clara, and their colleagues realized that R, the tool they had decided to learn for data analysis, could also do data visualization. As they began playing around with ggplot, they quickly saw its power. 

Clara said she found it "immediately addictive when I started working with ggplot to make charts." No longer limited by Chart Tools, she found that ggplot was "completely flexible in a way that was just completely new to me." 

The biggest change, though, came from not having to work with a designer. Not because the designers were bad (they weren't). But because ggplot allowed the BBC data journalists to explore different visualizations on their own. Working with a designer required the journalists to have a fully-formed idea that the designer could take and improve upon. Working in ggplot allowed BBC data journalists to explore different data viz ideas. 

Clara Guibourg believes this freedom is what explains the addictive quality of ggplot. As she told me, "even before we got anywhere near having a production-ready chart, just trying things out, visualizing things for the first time" was completely captivating. Having learned the basics of ggplot, she saw that "you can make like the simplest chart with just a couple of lines of code." Being able to explore different types of visualization on her own led Clara and others to produce more  data viz than they had previously. 

As the BBC data journalism team improved their ggplot skills, they realized that they could produce not only exploratory data viz, but also production-ready charts. They had learned to use R for data analysis, were starting to use it for exploratory data visualization, could they go all the way and create a chart in R that could go straight onto the BBC website? 

Nassos, Clara, and their colleagues set about looking into what would be involved in creating production-ready charts from R. They realized that so much of the work required to create production-ready charts involved small tweaks. What font should they use? Where should the legend go? Should axes have titles? Should charts have grid lines? 

The answers to these questions are what makes charts on-brand. Having consistent answers to them is what enabled BBC designers to turn Excel mockups into data viz ready to go on the website. As the BBC data journalism team dug further into ggplot, they realized that they might be able to write code to make their data viz production-ready. They realized that, if making production-ready charts required asking question about fonts, legends, axes, and grid lines, ggplot had an answer. And the answer was to make a custom theme. 

## Enter bbplot

TODO: Show example plot: https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/82BA/production/_121266433_beef_by_region_ws_640x3-nc.png (source: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46459714) 

### Show data

To show how `bbplot` works, let's create our own plot. We'll do so using the `palmerpenguins` package, which has data on penguins living on three islands in Antarctica. To give you a sense of what this data looks like, let's load `palmerpenguins` and the `tidyverse` packages.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

We now have data that we can work with in an object called `penguins`. Here's what the first ten rows look like.

```{r}
penguins
```
To get our data in a more usable format, let's count how many penguins live on each island. We do this with the `count()` function from the `dplyr` package (one of several packages that are loaded when we load the `tidyverse`).

```{r}
penguins %>%
  count(island)
```

Because we're going to use this data multiple times below, let's save it as an object called `penguins_summary`.

```{r}
penguins_summary <- penguins %>%
  count(island)
```

### Create plot

Now that we've got some data to work with, we're ready to create a plot. Before showing what `bbplot` does, let's make a plot with ggplot defaults. Of course, this isn't the most aesthetically pleasing chart. But we'll be improving it soon!

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins_summary,
  aes(
    x = island,
    y = n,
    fill = island
  )
) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Penguins by Island",
    subtitle = "Islands are in Antarctica",
    caption = "Data from palmerpenguins package"
  )
```

### Save plot as object

We're going to use this plot multiple times (with some modifications each time). To simplify things, let's save it as an object called `penguins_plot`. 

```{r}
penguins_plot <- ggplot(
  data = penguins_summary,
  aes(
    x = island,
    y = n,
    fill = island
  )
) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Penguins by Island",
    subtitle = "Islands are in Antarctica",
    caption = "Data from palmerpenguins package"
  )
```

### Apply bbc_style()

Now that we have a basic plot to work with, let's make it look like a BBC chart. To do this, we load the `bbplot` package. 

This package has two functions: `bbc_style()` and `finalise_plot()`. The latter deals with things like adding the BBC logo, saving plots in the correct dimensions, and other tasks done after the plot is complete. We'll discuss this a bit more below. 

For now, let's look at the `bbc_style()` function. This function applies a custom ggplot theme to any plot. Watch what happens when I apply it to our `penguins_plot`.


```{r}
library(bbplot)

penguins_plot +
  bbc_style()
```
Way different, right? Larger font size, legend on top, no axis titles, stripped down grid lines, and a white background – these are the major changes that the `bbc_style()` function makes. Let's look at them one by one. 

### Look at bbc_style() function

Here's the code for the `bbc_style()` function (taken from the `bbplot` GitHub repository, found at https://github.com/bbc/bbplot). 

You may be a bit confused by some of the code syntax used. First of all, this is the code used to create a function. The first line gives the function a name (`bbc_style`) and indicates that it is, in fact, a function definition. We'll discuss functions more in Chapter \@ref(functions).

You'll see that instead of loading the package `ggplot2` with the code `library(ggplot2)` and then using the `theme()` function, the code below uses `ggplot2::theme()`. This indicates that the `theme()` function comes from the `ggplot2` package. Writing code in this way is something that is done when making an R package, something we'll discuss in Chapter \@ref(custom-packages).

I've made some minor formatting tweaks for readability. For example, you can see the comments in ALL CAPS, which show the category of modification that the section which follows makes. Fortunately for us, the code is organized nicely and allows us to see what each section does. 

```{r}
bbc_style <- function() {
  font <- "Helvetica"
  
  ggplot2::theme(
    
    # TEXT FORMAT
    # This sets the font, size, type and colour of text for the chart's title
    plot.title = ggplot2::element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 28,
      face = "bold",
      color = "#222222"
    ),
    # This sets the font, size, type and colour of text for the chart's subtitle,
    # as well as setting a margin between the title and the subtitle
    plot.subtitle = ggplot2::element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 22,
      margin = ggplot2::margin(9, 0, 9, 0)
    ),
    # This leaves the caption text element empty, because it is set elsewhere in the finalise plot function
    plot.caption = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    
    # LEGEND FORMAT
    # This sets the position and alignment of the legend, removes a title and background for it
    # and sets the requirements for any text within the legend.
    # The legend may often need some more manual tweaking when it comes to its exact position based on the plot coordinates.
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.text.align = 0,
    legend.background = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    legend.title = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    legend.key = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    legend.text = ggplot2::element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 18,
      color = "#222222"
    ),
    
    # AXIS FORMAT
    # This sets the text font, size and colour for the axis test, as well as setting the margins and removes lines and ticks.
    # In some cases, axis lines and axis ticks are things we would want to have in the chart - the cookbook shows examples of how to do so.
    axis.title = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    axis.text = ggplot2::element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 18,
      color = "#222222"
    ),
    axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(margin = ggplot2::margin(5, b = 10)),
    axis.ticks = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    axis.line = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    
    # GRID LINES
    # This removes all minor gridlines and adds major y gridlines.
    # In many cases you will want to change this to remove y gridlines and add x gridlines.
    # The cookbook shows you examples for doing so.
    panel.grid.minor = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = ggplot2::element_line(color = "#cbcbcb"),
    panel.grid.major.x = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    
    # BLANK BACKGROUND
    # This sets the panel background as blank, removing the standard grey ggplot background colour from the plot.
    panel.background = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    
    # STRIP BACKGROUND
    # This sets the panel background for facet-wrapped plots to white,
    # removing the standard grey ggplot background colour and sets the title size of the facet-wrap title to font size 22.
    strip.background = ggplot2::element_rect(fill = "white"),
    strip.text = ggplot2::element_text(size = 22, hjust = 0)
  )
}
```

Nearly all of the code in the `bbc_style()` function exists within the `theme()` function from `ggplot2`. In the last chapter, we saw how Cédric Scherer and Georgios Karamanis customized their plot by applying the `theme_light()` function. This a so-called complete theme, meaning you can call the function and will change the whole look-and-feel of your plot. Cédric and Georgios then used the `theme()` function make additional tweaks. The `bbc_style()` theme does not use a complete theme to start. Instead, by jumping straight into the `theme()` function, they make tweaks to the base ggplot theme (TODO: Add something about it being gray? Or is that too niche?). 

It can be challenging to remember how to tweak different elements in a plot. Fortunately, there are cheatsheets available to help. This one by Clara Granell shows the various elements that you can tweak within the `theme()` function. 

https://github.com/claragranell/ggplot2/blob/main/ggplot_theme_system_cheatsheet.pdf

As you can see, the `bbc_style()` function does a lot of tweaking. So, let's go through the changes it makes, section by section. 

### Text formatting

The first section of the code deals with text formatting. First, it defines a variable called "font" and assigns it the value "Helvetica." This allows later sections of code to simply write "font" rather than repeating "Helvetica" over and over again. And, if the team ever wanted to use a different font, they could simply change "Helvetica" to, say, "Comic Sans" and change all BBC plots (I suspect higher-ups at the BBC might not be on board). 

```{r}
font <- "Helvetica"
```


Subsequent pieces of this section of the code make changes to the title, subtitle, and caption. The pattern used in code to make changes is as follows:

```{r eval = FALSE}
AREA = ELEMENT_TYPE(
  PROPERTY = VALUE
)
```

We begin by selecting an area (e.g. `plot.title`). Then, we have to say what type of element it is. The options are `element_text()`, `element_line()`, `element_rect()`, and `element_blank()`. We'll deal with the other three later on. For now, we're working with `element_text()` to handle formatting of the title, subtitle, and caption since they're all text elements. 

TODO: Add something about making everything bigger per what Nassos said?

The code first formats the title using Helvetica 28-point bold font in a nearly black color (that's the hex code #222222). The subtitle is 22-point Helvetica. Some spacing is added between the title and subtitle using the `margin()` function, which gives the spacing, in points, for the top (9), right (0), bottom (9), and left (0) sides. Finally, the caption is removed using the `element_blank()` function. This is done because the `bbplot` package has another function called `finalise_plot()` that adds elements, including a caption and the BBC logo to the bottom of plots. 

```{r}
penguins_plot +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 28,
      face = "bold",
      color = "#222222"
    ),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 22,
      margin = margin(9, 0, 9, 0)
    ),
    plot.caption = element_blank()
  )
```

TODO: mention something about saving this, as below?

```{r}
penguins_plot_text <- penguins_plot +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 28,
      face = "bold",
      color = "#222222"
    ),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 22,
      margin = margin(9, 0, 9, 0)
    ),
    plot.caption = element_blank()
  )
```


### Legend

Next, we deal with the legend. The code puts the legend on top of the plot, and left aligns the text within it Then, it removes the legend background (TODO: not sure when this would ever actually show up), title, and legend key (this is a box that can show up around the boxes with the names of the islands). Finally, we make the text 18-point Helevetica with the same nearly black color. 

```{r}
penguins_plot_text +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.text.align = 0,
    legend.background = element_blank(),
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    legend.key = element_blank(),
    legend.text = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 18,
      color = "#222222"
    )
  )
```

```{r}
penguins_plot_legend <- penguins_plot_text +
  theme(
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.text.align = 0,
    legend.background = element_blank(),
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    legend.key = element_blank(),
    legend.text = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 18,
      color = "#222222"
    )
  )
```

### Axes

Next up are the axes. The code first removes axis titles because, as TODO told me, "TODO add quote here." All text on axes becomes 18-point Helevetica nearly black. The text on the x axis (in our case, Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen) gets a bit of spacing around it. And, finally, both axis ticks and axis lines are removed. 

```{r}
penguins_plot_legend +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 18,
      color = "#222222"
    ),
    axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(5, b = 10)),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.line = element_blank()
  )
```

```{r}
penguins_plot_axes <- penguins_plot_legend +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 18,
      color = "#222222"
    ),
    axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(5, b = 10)),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.line = element_blank()
  )
```

### Grid lines

Now that we've tweaked overall text formatting, the legend, and the axes, let's move onto grid lines. The approach here is fairly straightforward: remove all minor grid lines, remove major grid lines on the x axis, keeping only major grid lines on the y axis, but making them a light gray (#cbcbcb). We can see the result of these tweaks to the grid lines.

```{r}
penguins_plot_axes +
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "#cbcbcb"),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()
  )
```

```{r}
penguins_plot_grid_lines <- penguins_plot_axes +
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "#cbcbcb"),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()
  )
```

### Backgrounds

Of course, in the last iteration of our plot, it still had a gray background. The `bbc_style()` function removes this with the following line:

#### Panel

```{r}
penguins_plot_grid_lines +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_blank()
  )
```

And there we go! We've now recreated the plot that we made above using the `bbc_style()` function. However, you may recall there is a bit more code in the `bbc_style()` function. This code deals with `strip.background` and `strip.text`. Both of these elements occur when we make small multiples charts. Small multiples is a common technique in data visualization, where, instead of making one chart that incorporates all of the available data, we break the chart into multiple charts in order to make the final results easier for the reader to comprehend. 

When we use the `facet_wrap()` function, we are left with one chart per island. But note that, by default, the text above each chart is noticeably smaller than the rest of the chart. And the gray background behind the text stands out when we have removed the gray background from other parts of the chart. 

#### Strip

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(island, sex) %>%
  summarize(avg_weight = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  drop_na(sex) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = sex,
    y = avg_weight,
    fill = island
  )) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Penguin Weight by Island and Sex") +
  facet_wrap(~island) +
  theme(
    
    plot.title = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 28,
      face = "bold",
      color = "#222222"
    ),
    
    plot.subtitle = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 22,
      margin = margin(9, 0, 9, 0)
    ),
    
    plot.caption = element_blank(),
    
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.text.align = 0,
    legend.background = element_blank(),
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    legend.key = element_blank(),
    legend.text = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 18,
      color = "#222222"
    ),
    
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 18,
      color = "#222222"
    ),
    axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(5, b = 10)),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.line = element_blank(),
    
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "#cbcbcb"),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    
    panel.background = element_blank()
  )
```

```{r}
penguins_plot_weight <- penguins %>%
  group_by(island, sex) %>%
  summarize(avg_weight = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  drop_na(sex) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = sex,
    y = avg_weight,
    fill = island
  )) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Penguin Weight by Island and Sex") +
  facet_wrap(~island) +
  theme(
    
    plot.title = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 28,
      face = "bold",
      color = "#222222"
    ),
    
    plot.subtitle = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 22,
      margin = margin(9, 0, 9, 0)
    ),
    
    plot.caption = element_blank(),
    
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.text.align = 0,
    legend.background = element_blank(),
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    legend.key = element_blank(),
    legend.text = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 18,
      color = "#222222"
    ),
    
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_text(
      family = font,
      size = 18,
      color = "#222222"
    ),
    axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(5, b = 10)),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.line = element_blank(),
    
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "#cbcbcb"),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    
    panel.background = element_blank()
  )
```

So, in order to change these elements, we remove the background and make the text larger and left aligned (using `hjust = 0`). 

```{r}
penguins_plot_weight +
  theme(
    strip.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 22, hjust = 0)
  )
```
